# Human Activity Recognition Using Smartphones Dataset

This repository contains a tidy dataset with sensor signal readings for 30 subjects performing various activities (WALKING, WALKING_UPSTAIRS, WALKING_DOWNSTAIRS, SITTING, STANDING, LAYING) collected from a Samsung Galaxy S II smartphone.

This dataset was derived from a source dataset available at https://d396qusza40orc.cloudfront.net/getdata%2Fprojectfiles%2FUCI%20HAR%20Dataset.zip

The dataset can be derived again by executing run_analysis.R; this script will re-download the source data, perform a number of transformations, then output the new dataset as "subject_activity_averages.txt".
